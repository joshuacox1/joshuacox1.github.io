  <h1>Benson&#8217;s theorem of unconditional life</h1>

  <p>In Go, a player&#8217;s group is said to be <em>pass-alive</em> if it is impossible for that group to be captured assuming that player constantly passes. This definition is not particularly helpful for determining whether a particular group is pass-alive. <strong>Benson&#8217;s theorem</strong> proves that a particular characterisation of groups is equivalent to the pass-aliveness.</p>

  <p>Some definitions. Write \(p\) for the playerTODO and \(O(p)\) for their opponent. Write \(X\) for a set of \(p\)-coloured groups.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <em>region</em> is a connected set of intersections.</li>
    <li>A <em>\(p\)-enclosed region</em> of a set of \(p\)-coloured groups \(X\) is a maximal region containing no stones of colour \(p\), whose \(p\)-coloured bordering groups are a subset of \(X\).</li>
    <li>A \(p\)-enclosed region of a set of \(p\)-groups \(X\) is <em>vital</em> to a \(p\)-group if all its empty intersections are liberties of that \(p\)-group.</li>
    <li>A small \(p\)-enclosed </li>
  </ul>
